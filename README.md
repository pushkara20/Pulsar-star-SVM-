My goal was to showcase my machine learning skills, especially in Support vector machine, by building two SVM models with different parameters. These models were used to classify the signals from outer space as either pulsar stars or noise from other sources. I used a dataset from Kaggle that contained the signals received from the space by scientists. The dataset had both pulsar star signals and noise signals. My process involved manipulating the dataset, splitting the dataset, building the models, evaluating the models' performance, making predictions, and visualizing the confusion matrix (Heat map).
