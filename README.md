2 SVM models with different parameter were built to know the signals from the outer space is from the pulsar star or is it a noise from the outer? This model was mainly built to demonstrate the skills I posses in machine learning, to be precise Support vector machine. Dataset was available on Kaggle, it consist the signal scientist received from the space, it has both signals from the pulsar star and from other outer bodies. model includes manipulating the dataset, splitting the dataset, building the model, evaluating the model performance, prediction, visualizing the confusion matrix (Heat map).
